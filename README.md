This repo contains the source scripts and data used for a manuscript submitted to Water Resources Research.
The widths data were extraxted from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and Planet lab imagery.
The priors are USGS gauge discharge records and the reanalysis runoff-transformed discharge from NCEP, MERRA-2 and ERA5.
The Orthogonals are the orthogonal lines at cross sections for each reach, from which the widths were extracted.
