The links files are used to link cross sections for planet data and cross sections for landsat and sentinel data. 
The plID is the row number of planet width data files located in data/Widths/Planet, and ID is the row nnumber in the landsat and sentinel-2 width data files that are located at data/Widths/Landsat and data/Widths/Sentinel-2, respectively.
The plID is the 'FID' in the orthogonal files (e.g., 15493400_orthogonal_ID.dbf) located in data/Orthogonals
The ID is 'ID' in the orthogonal files (e.g., 15493400_orthogonal_ID.dbf) located in data/Orthogonals

The width_mean.txt is the summarized average width for each satellite and each reach
The width_count.txt is the summarized number of usable images for each satellite and each reach
